        <p class="verse">Verse 1: There ain't no gold in this river<br>
            That I've been washin' my hands in forever<br>
            I know there is hope in these waters<br>
            But I can't bring myself to swim<br>
            When I am drowning in this silence<br>
            Baby, let me in
        </p>
    
        <p class="chorus">Chorus: Go easy on me, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel the world around me<br>
            I had no time to choose what I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
        </p>
    
        <p class="verse">Verse 2: Go easy on mе, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel thе world around me<br>
            Had no time to choose what I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
    
        <p class="chorus">Chorus 2: I had good intentions<br>
            And the highest hopes<br>
            But I know right now<br>
            It probably doesn't even show<br>
    
        <p class="chorus">Chorus 3: Go easy on me, baby<br>
            I was still a child<br>
            I didn't get the chance to<br>
            Feel the world around me<br>
            I had no time to choose what I chose to do<br>
            So go easy on me<br>
